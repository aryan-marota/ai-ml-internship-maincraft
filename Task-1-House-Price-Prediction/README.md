# California House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project was completed as part of **Task 1** of my **AI & Machine Learning Internship at Maincraft Technologies**.

The objective of this task is to build and evaluate a Linear Regression model to predict house prices using the California Housing Dataset.

- 8 input features
- Target: Median House Value

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🧠 Model Used
