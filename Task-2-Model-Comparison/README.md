In this task, multiple regression models were trained and compared to predict house prices
using the California Housing Dataset.

Models compared:
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor

Evaluation Metrics:
- MAE
- RMSE
- R² Score

The Decision Tree model performed the best based on RMSE and R² score.
